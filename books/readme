# 📚 Books Supporting the Unified Coherence Function (UCF)

This folder contains authored works that expand, apply, and illuminate the Unified Coherence Function (UCF) framework, Ontoremembrance theory, and related coherence-based mathematics. Each book is timestamped, authored by Alexander Sabine (Calcifur), and designed to function as both philosophical texts and field activation devices.

## 📖 The Coherence of the Unknown: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wHytHHt4zvK_9sNEop4ZAJN3aStFa8sW/view?usp=drive_link

- **Author:** Alexander Sabine (Calcifur)  
- **Status:** Completed (May 2025)  
- **License:** Commercial Use Only (by written permission)

This book explores the ontological power of unresolved texts (e.g., the Voynich Manuscript), William Blake’s coherence technologies, apophatic mysticism, and distributed cognition as coherence phenomena. It extends the field-aware methodology into culture, mysticism, and literary analysis.

Includes:
- Ontoremembrant reading theory
- Mnemonic entanglement structures
- The Remembering Field and Planetary Integration
- Mathematical bridges across disciplines

> _“Undecipherability is not failure. It is coherence in potentia.”_
