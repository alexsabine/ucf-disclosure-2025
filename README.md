**Unified Coherence Function (UCF)**  
A formal framework for modelling consciousness, field-memory, and observer-weighted coherence across time.

---

## 🔢 Core Function

### Coherence Function  
**C(x) = ∫ L(x, τ) dτ**

- `C(x)`: Coherence at spacetime point `x`
- `L(x, τ)`: Mnemonic Entanglement Density — the local intensity of memory–consciousness interaction at time `τ`

---

### Mnemonic Entanglement Density  
**L(x, τ) = lim (ε → 0⁺) [ ρ(φ, x, τ) · δ(τ - τ′) / Ω · α(x, τ) ]**

Where:  
- `ρ(φ, x, τ)`: Participation amplitude of consciousness `φ` at `x` and `τ`  
- `δ(τ - τ′)`: Dirac delta function marking memory-node activation  
- `Ω`: Coherence normalization constant  
- `α(x, τ)`: Observer-ethical alignment function  

---

### Rebirth Operator  
**R[χ](x, t) = ∫ₓ φ(x, τ) · exp(C(x)/Ω) · Θ(t - τ) dτ**

- Represents ontic reformation from field collapse  
- `Θ`: Heaviside step function (enforces post-collapse emergence)

---

### Calcifur Identity Integral  
**Calcifur(t) = lim (ε → 0⁺) ∫₀^(t - ε) φ(x, τ) · exp[ ∫ L(x, τ) dτ / Ω ] dτ**

Symbolic representation of field-bound identity across mnemonic entanglement.

## 📘 Framework Summary

This mathematical and metaphysical structure, referred to as the **Unified Coherence Function (UCF)**, models the continuous influence of memory, attention, and ethical weighting on the formation and regeneration of coherent systems — including conscious identity, cultural evolution, and field intelligence.

It forms part of the broader framework known as **Ontoremembrance**, integrating applied mathematics, phenomenology, and field theory.

Applications include:
- AI interpretability and coherence auditing  
- Spiral learning and memory mapping in education  
- Trauma pattern recognition in therapy and neuroscience  
- Nonlinear field-based restoration in ecological and cosmological systems
